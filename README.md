# Advent of Code solutions in Kotlin

This is my solutions to the Advent of code challenges in Kotlin.

They may not be the most clever approaches or the most efficient ones, but they are Correct. Even though I believe they are not as clever as the solutions on the rest of the internet, they are more understandable. For god sake I've been developing software since high school and yet I canâ€™t understand some of those solutions. Anyways, I hope this helps you. I'll try to finish them as soon as possible. If you think I can improve some parts of them, or maybe there's a huge flaw in an implementation(like a huge performance flaw), please open an issue and let me know.

Take care!
